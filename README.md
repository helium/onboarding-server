# Onboarding Server
The onboarding server allows makers to manage their hotspot production and permit hotspot customers to onboard them to the blockchain.

## Development

Before running the following commands, make sure to have a running postgres db instance.

- clone the repo
- run `yarn install`
- initialize the database with `yarn db:create`
- run the migrations with `yarn db:migrate`
- run `yarn task src/tasks/create_maker.js` and follow the prompts to create or import a Maker record
- run the dev server with `yarn dev`
- the dev server will be accessible at `localhost:3002`

## Production

When running in production, make sure to set the following env vars to secure random values:

| Environment Variable | Description                               | Example                                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| KEYRING              | JSON keyring object                       | {"1":"2xNJEZvMlr99yPqGfh0sa7pO7j1tH73RTU9qJwwi4bs="} |
| KEYRING_SALT         | Additional entropy for keyring encryption | WmcKZ46ciIZqTvXm9TMd5V63b8k6iw/tVkcv/qEI0KU=         |

(add more important vars here)


The recommended way of generating secure secrets is:

```
dd if=/dev/urandom bs=32 count=1 2>/dev/null | openssl base64 -A
```

Refer to [https://github.com/fnando/keyring-node](https://github.com/fnando/keyring-node) for additional details about how the at-rest encryption with keyring works.

### Rate Limiting

In production it is recommended to enable rate limiting to prevent nefarious users from scraping or brute forcing the APIs. Rate limiting relies on Redis to store IP addresses and request counts. Redis connection info is supplied through a `REDIS_URL` env var.

### Heroku

The onboarding server is configured to run on Heroku out of the box. It will use the nodejs buildpack, and comes with a Procfile that defines the web resource command as `npm start`. Additionally, the free Heroku Redis add-on can be installed and will automatically be picked up by the rate limiter. 

Admin tasks can be run on Heroku like so: `heroku run yarn task src/tasks/create_maker.js`

## Admin Tasks

The following tasks are included for managing admin functionality of the onboarding server:

### Create Maker

`yarn task src/tasks/create_maker.js`

Creates a Maker account taking name, location nonce limit and optionally an exported wallet entropy string. You can also choose to create a Maker API token for the newly created Maker.
### Create Token

`yarn task src/tasks/create_token.js`

Creates a Maker API token for the selected Maker.

### Export Maker

`yarn task src/tasks/export_maker.js`

Exports the **unencrypted** wallet entropy seed to be imported into another onboarding server instance.

## Onboarding Server Maker API

- Base route: `/api/v2`

### Authentication
With all requests, include an `authorization` header where the value is your public token and private token joined with a colon (`:`). For example:

```
curl --location --request GET 'https://onboarding.example.com/api/v2/hotspots' \
--header 'authorization: pk_INSERT_REST_OF_PUBLIC_TOKEN:sk_INSERT_REST_OF_SECRET_TOKEN'
```

### Other Headers
With all POST and PUT requests that contain a body, include the `Content-Type: application/json` header. For example:

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://onboarding.example.com/api/v2/hotspots' \
--header 'Authorization: auth_tokens_here' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "macWlan0": "example mac"
}'
```

### Hotspots
This API allows a Maker to create and manage their Hotspots.

#### Index

##### Route:
`GET /hotspots`
